**Non-detection of Pulsars** - <br>
In astronomy, there exists a problem of non-detection of pulsars. What this means is, that the SNR is so low that the images captured look like they’re just noise. To get rid of this, and to obtain a good image with a detected pulsar, stacking of images is used. There are two methods- mean stacking and median stacking.

**Sky analysis** <br>
In astronomy, images can be obtained from different electromagnetic bands. Different features are visible in different bands, hence it’s necessary to look at them all. Sometimes to make sure a particular entity is detected in the sky, it’s checked using other band images too. For eg. entity X is visible in band A and band B. Say, I obtain some signal in band A, which I’m ot sure denotes X or not. To make sure, I would check for signals in the same region of band B image. If it is there, then X was correctly detected, else no. This checking is done through cross-checking algorithm and is used to make sky catalogues.
